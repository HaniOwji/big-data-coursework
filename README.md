# Big Data Coursework (Jupyter Notebook)

This repository contains a university coursework project completed for a Big Data module. The project is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on fundamental big data analytics tasks such as data loading, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and basic insights using Python.

## Contents
- `big-data-coursework.ipynb` — main notebook including data preparation, analysis, and visualisation steps

## Results
The notebook demonstrates basic big data analytics techniques covered in the course, including data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and exploratory data analysis using visualisations. The focus of this project is on understanding fundamental concepts rather than building production-level systems.
